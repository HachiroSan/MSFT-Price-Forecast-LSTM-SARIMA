# MSFT-Price-Forecast-LSTM-SARIMA

This repository serves as a platform for exploring stock price prediction methodologies using Python. In this project, we delve into the prediction of future prices for Microsoft stock, employing two distinct approaches: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA).

### Project Overview:

Objective: Our primary objective is to compare the effectiveness of LSTM and SARIMA in predicting Microsoft stock prices.
Methods: LSTM, a deep learning model known for capturing sequential patterns, and SARIMA, a classic time series analysis technique, are the two methodologies under scrutiny.
Implementation: The repository provides dedicated folders for LSTM and SARIMA models, each containing relevant code and documentation.
Data: Historical stock price data for Microsoft forms the basis for training and evaluation of the models.
